# Customer Data
Customer Segmentation for a Subscription Service.

I used the same excel workbook for both Project 1 and Project 2

## MICROSOFT EXCEL STEPS
- I cleaned my dataset by selecting the dataset using ctrl+shift+end to select my dataset, then I clicked DATA on the toolbar then clicked on remove duplicates. This helped me removed any duplicate rows.
- I eliminated all blank spaces by selecting the dataset then click on DATA in the tool bar then I selected "Find and select", look for "special", clicked on "blanks", then the blank spaces was selected and then i deleted.
- My dataset was clean and ready and read to use
- I proceeded to do the project task where I was to find the subscription pattern, average subscription duration and identify the most popular
subscription types.


### Subscription Pattern

The goal is to understand the behavior of customers in terms of their subscriptions. I tried revealing the Subscription patterns by calculating insights such as:
  1. Which subscription types are most or least popular.

  2. Revenue generated per customer or per subscription type.

  3. The cancellation rates across different types or regions.

  4. Average revenue generated per customer or per subscription Region.

  5. Average Duration

This approach should provide a comprehensive overview of the subscription patterns within the data, allowing you to identify high-revenue areas, popular subscription types, and potential retentionÂ issues.


- I calculated the average subscription duration using pivot table and identifed the most popular
subscription types to be **BASIC**

##MY SQL
1 retrieve the total number of customers from each region.
o find the most popular subscription type by the number of customers.
o find customers who canceled their subscription within 6 months.
o calculate the average subscription duration for all customers.
o find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
o calculate total revenue by subscription type.
o find the top 3 regions by subscription cancellations.
o find the total number of active and canceled subscriptions.
